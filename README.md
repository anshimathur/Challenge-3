# **Banking System Project**

## **Goal**
The goal of this project is to design and implement a modular **Banking System** that enables users to:
- Manage their bank account balances effectively.
- Calculate and display interest earned for both **Savings** and **Certificate of Deposit (CD)** accounts.
- Provide a user-friendly interface for real-time interaction and account management.


## **Problem/Question**
How can we create a simple, modular banking system using object-oriented programming (OOP) that:
1. Accurately calculates interest for multiple account types.
2. Allows for easy scalability and maintainability.
3. Ensures clear and consistent user interaction while managing account data.


## **Unique or Interesting Observations**
During development, the following was discovered:
- **Scalability through modularity**: Breaking the code into smaller modules for each account type (Savings and CD) helped reduce complexity and improve reusability.
- **Interest calculation nuances**: Using annual interest rates required careful conversion for monthly calculations.
- **Object-oriented design**: Centralizing shared functionality in a base `Account` class significantly improved code clarity and reduced redundancy.

## **Conclusion**
This project demonstrates how modular and object-oriented programming can solve real-world problems in a scalable and maintainable manner. 
The design principles applied here provide a strong foundation for future enhancements, such as:
- *Adding more account types like loans or checking accounts.*
- *Integrating error handling and validations.*
- *Expanding the system with a database to manage multiple users.*
