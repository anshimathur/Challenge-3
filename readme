# **Banking System Project**

## **Goal**
The goal of this project is to design and implement a modular **Banking System** that enables users to:
- Manage their bank account balances effectively.
- Calculate and display interest earned for both **Savings** and **Certificate of Deposit (CD)** accounts.
- Provide a user-friendly interface for real-time interaction and account management.

## **Problem/Question**
How can we create a simple, modular banking system using object-oriented programming that:
1. Accurately calculates interest for multiple account types.
2. Allows for easy scalability and maintainability.
3. Ensures clear and consistent user interaction while managing account data.

## **Unique or Interesting Observations**
During development, we discovered the following:
- **Scalability through modularity**: Breaking the code into smaller modules for each account type (Savings and CD) helped reduce complexity and improve reusability.
- **Interest calculation nuances**: Using annual interest rates required careful conversion for monthly calculations.
- **Object-oriented design**: Centralizing shared functionality in a base `Account` class significantly improved code clarity and reduced redundancy.
